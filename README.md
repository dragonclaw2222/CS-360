The goal of my app was to be able to have a user access it through a login screen be prompted for text message notifications and track items in a manageable grid based UI.
This was to allow users to effectively manage and keep track of inventory.
To keep it simple as possible I kept this to be the login screen, message authorization screen, then the inventory screen.
My goal was to keep it as simple and clean as possible to allow all information to be easily understood at a glance.
I tested all the features through the Android Studio virtual phone feature through multiple iterations.
I feel i was most successful in my implementation of the main inventory menus allowing for smooth addition and deletion of items in the list.
